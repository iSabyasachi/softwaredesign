Why we need SOLID principles?

1. To reduce dependencies so that engineers change one area of software without impacting others.
2. To make designs easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
3. to avoid issues and to build adaptive, effective, and agile software.

They lead to better code for readability, maintainability, design patterns, and testability.
